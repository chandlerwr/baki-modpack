# More Company!

This mod is a lobby player count expansion mod. It increases the max player count to 32!

The mod is specifically designed for 8 players. UI modifications will not properly accomodate for above 8 players.

# Why this mod? Isn't there another mod that does the same thing?
Yes, although there is another mod that does a very similar thing, it has a few stability issues regarding the functionality of the game. In the development of MoreCompany, I had stability and polish in mind, I wanted to make a relatively frictionless experience regarding expanded player counts.

In my testing of an 8 player lobby, I experienced no issues nor did anyone else in the lobby. Alot of game conditions were tested, but there may be conditions which were not tested that may be broken or cause a softlock. If you experience issues like these, please let me know at the Discord server linked at the bottom of this page.

This mod is not affiliated with BiggerLobby/LethalPlayers nor does it use any code from that mod! Any similarities are purely coincidental.

# ``Installation``
```
- Install BepinEx.
- Place BepInEx/plugins/MoreCompany.dll in your BepInEx/plugins folder.
- Make sure everyone joining you has this mod installed.
```

# Features
- Cosmetics

# Minor Features
- The scavenge results screen has been modified to fit 8 players and will show their missing/deceased/alive states accordingly.
- The spectating screen properly fits greater than 4 players if they die. (They will not go offscreen)
- The quickmenu player volume section accounts for greater than 4 players, with a scrollable UI.

# Notice
If playing on a save that previously had the BiggerLobby mod, you may encounter significantly more instability issues than usual. I recommend playing it safe and wiping BiggerLobby saves and making new MoreCompany ones.
