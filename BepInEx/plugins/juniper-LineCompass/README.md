There is a 45 degree offset from the POV of the monitor in the space ship. In the space ship, center-top makes sense as north, but using that direction as north leads to all of the paths inside the buildings resting between cardinal directions (SW/NE etc). By making north the top-right of the screen, it makes it more comfortable for those inside the building.
